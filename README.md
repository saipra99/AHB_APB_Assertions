# AHB_APB_Assertions
The following repository includes all the assertions of AMBA 3 AHB-Lite & AMBA 3 APB Protocol assertions that were modelled for future project implemetatation purposes.

AHB stands for the acronym "Advanced High Speed" bus which is a shared bus just like APB protocol largely used for high bandwidth peripheral interconnect which mainly consists of CPU, DMA, High bandwidth memory, DSP and other high performance based functional IPs.

Whereas on the other hand, APB stands for "Advanced Peripheral Bus" was one the finest inventions of ARM Holding which standardized the on chip communication of for low bandwidth peripheral interconnects. It's a non-pipelined, and low cost bus which consumes very less power as compared to its parent versions. Its widely used for connecting internal registers and serial communication protocols and  most of the control and data signals to this interface are through AHB-APB bridge which is an interface responsible for scaling/ down the transfer speed from AHB/ASB to APB.
